- Some challenges in the software development

    - Flexible code
    - Extensible code
    - Maintainable code

A **design pattern** is a common repeatable solution for creating software programs

Add new features; Update features; Replace features; Apply program in different situations

Around 23 design patterns: Creational; Structural; Behaviorial

## Creational Design Pattern
It is to efficiently create objects to increase flexibility
- Factory method

### Inheritence vs. composition
- Sometimes inheritence may cause class explosion
- If a parent class is too general, some properties might not be used by some inherited classes

Use inheritence together with composition. Then there is no extra shared code by all classes 

- Compositon: Properties referenced by another class. One class is using or consisting of another
- Inheritence: Class extends another class
